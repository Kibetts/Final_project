          <h2>FAQs</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Why are bees important to the environment?</strong><br>
            Bees play a crucial role in pollination, which is essential for the reproduction of flowering plants and the production of fruits, vegetables, and seeds. They contribute to the biodiversity of ecosystems and support the growth of crops, ensuring food security and maintaining a healthy environment.<br><br>
          
            <strong>How is honey made?</strong><br>
            Honey is produced by bees through a process that starts with collecting nectar from flowers. Bees convert the nectar into honey by adding enzymes and reducing the moisture content through evaporation. Once the honey is sufficiently ripened, the bees store it in cells within the hive, where it matures and becomes ready for harvest by beekeepers.<br><br>
          
            <strong>Is raw honey different from processed honey?</strong><br>
            Yes, raw honey is different from processed honey. Raw honey is obtained directly from the hive and is minimally processed, retaining its natural enzymes, pollen, and other beneficial components. Processed honey undergoes filtration and heat treatment, which may affect its flavor, texture, and nutritional value.<br><br>
          
            <strong>What are the health benefits of honey?</strong><br>
            Honey offers several health benefits due to its natural properties. It is rich in antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, and enzymes. Honey has antibacterial and antifungal properties and can soothe coughs, aid in wound healing, and act as a natural energy booster. However, it's important to note that honey should not be given to infants under one year old due to the risk of botulism.<br><br>
          
            <strong>Are your honey and bee-related products sustainably sourced?</strong><br>
            Yes, at our company, we prioritize sustainability in our honey sourcing and bee-related products. We work closely with local beekeepers who follow sustainable beekeeping practices, prioritize hive health, and promote biodiversity conservation. Our products are sourced responsibly, ensuring a positive impact on both the environment and the communities we work with.
